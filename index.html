            <h2>Why Normalized Curves?</h2>
            <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 20px;">
                To verify that candidates are true "sleeping beauties," we normalize by:
            </p>
            <ul class="criteria-list">
                <li><strong>Years since publication:</strong> X-axis shows "years since publication" (Year 0 = publication year) instead of absolute year — this aligns curves regardless of when paper was published</li>
                <li><strong>Cumulative fraction:</strong> Y-axis shows fraction of total citations accumulated (0 to 1) — this normalizes for different total citation counts</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Expected SB pattern:</strong> A flat line near 0 for early years (dormancy), then sharp rise in later years (awakening). A "step" or "sigmoid" shape indicates a true sleeping beauty.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Normalized Citation Curves</h2>
            <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 20px;">
                These plots show cumulative fraction of total citations vs. years since publication. 
                <strong>Red line</strong> marks the 3-year mark (end of "early" period).
